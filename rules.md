The Vancouver Blender User Group is a collection of artists, developers, and other people interested in Blender or art and technology in the same space. While we operate in Vancouver, BC, we welcome anyone from anywhere around the world. The spirit of the group and the intention of the rules list is to create an environment where members of the community can feel safe in sharing their work without fear of being attacked for their work or who they are.

If you believe or have witnessed someone behaving in a way that goes against the spirit of the group, please contact the VanBUG admin team on Discord or Meetup.com. The VanBUG team will investigate issues brought up to them and determine the best course of action. Generally anything that could be considered by a reasonable person to be minor or otherwise accidential would be a warning, but acting with malicious intent or performing an action that a reasonable person would consider to be bannable behaviour is an immediate ban. Bans may be lifted if we believe the banned person has corrected their behaviour. We also reserve the right to report behaviours to the platforms in which the behaviour happened on.

Rules
=====

Main
----

The following rules are the main set of rules that we operate under. We also adhere to rules set by the platforms we use, so if there are any doubts, then choose the most conservative rules. The rules generally fall into the categories of "be kind to each other" and "don't break rules of the platforms we use and the countries we live in".

- Do not harm, threaten to harm, harass, or otherwise attack people.
- Do not share works that you do not have permission to share. For example, pirated software, or content under NDA (non-disclosure agreements).
- Do not engage in illegal activities or promote illegal activities.
- Feedback must be constructive and sincere. Avoid saying things like "I don't like it" or "I like it" without explaining why.
- No explicit, excessively graphic, or excessively shocking material. For example, pornography or excessive gore.
- Nudity, minor graphic, or minor shocking material is allowed as long as the platform the content is shared on allows it, and the community can opt-in to seeing the content. For example, a URL that is explicity marked as nudity or gory.
- No sexualizing minors. This includes creating content where the subject appears to be minor (even if they are not) and is in a compromising pose/attire.
